# tictactoe
2019 Tic Tac Toe Championships!

This is a React coding project, created as an assignment at LEARN Academy. The game board is an array of 9 squares, with a winner automatically calculated when one player creates a row of 3. 

The winner is then announced with an alert box and the board resets!
